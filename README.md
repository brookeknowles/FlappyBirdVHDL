# FlappyBirdVHDL

This is a clone of the popular mobile game [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/), made entirely in VHDL using digital logic and digital design. 
The game was made to be run on an Altera DE0 Board equipped with the Cyclone III FPGA device connected to a VGA monitor, and played using a PS/2 mouse.
